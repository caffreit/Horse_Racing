# Horses_Idiro
Group Repo for the Horse dataset

**Heredity:**
Are there Dams/Sires etc. with best/worst offspring. How much does heredity matter, affect offspring performance?
Do certain parents give offspring with particular traits? Sprinter, long distance etc.
We have very few dams/sires running in our dataset (just the offspring) so we can’t check how parental traits affect offspring traits.

**Handicap:**
Does the handicap have the desired effect on horse performance. Is it too light/heavy? What is the ideal?
Is there room for improvement? If handicaps are too heavy or too light to mitigate recent performance is there value in betting on over/under-handicapped horses?

**Horseform:**
Is there a simple way to transform this to a single number the punter could use to help him get better value at the track?
Is there a more complicated way we could use with a computer to get value?

**Jockey/Trainer/Owner:**
How much does a jockey add to a horse’s performance. How do we disentangle the effect of the horse and the jockey on the outcome of the race. How much value (not punter value) does the jockey bring? (Shapley values, Causal inference to remove confounder…?)
Are there trainer-trainer, trainer-jockey, trainer-owner, pairs that we can show are in cahoots. Price swings, favourites underperforming more than expected.

**Price movement:**
If there is a large price move, what does that mean for betting. If it shortens, is this inside info should we pile in? Betting by insiders?

**Place bets:**
Generally accepted there’s better value to be had in place bets. Can we scrape timeform site to get finishing positions? Can we show better value in the each way bets?


**Tote market:**
Best strategy? Anything interesting to say here?

**Distance preference of horses:**

**How good are tipsters?**

**Inefficiency of betting market?**
Favourite long-shot bias, price swings, insider knowledge etc.

**What are the best strategies for betting?**
Bet on favourite or long shot? Or other simple features that the punter can use at the track? Is there something more complex we can do? Compare performance of random betting, betting on long shot, favourite, other simple strategies, some cleverer ones. Use Monte Carlo sims to do this.
